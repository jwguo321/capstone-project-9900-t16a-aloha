**Front End Server**
There are no additional environments for running front-end. 

Chrome is recommended browser to use.

The back-end server needs to start first to run front-end.

To run the front-end server, at the root folder of the project.

`npx http-server web -c-1 -p 7999`

This will start a server to host the front-end web site. 

Visit on either:
  http://127.0.0.1:7999
  http://192.168.1.168:7999
  
 
1. If you are running on UNSW CSE machine. It will ask you to install the http-server. 
2. If you are running on your own machine, Nodejs is needed to run this command.
3. Or you can use any other server to run the front-end. For example, python server.
